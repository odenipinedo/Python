    "    - set of tools for making computers behave intelligently using computer science and robotics.\n",
    "- Machine learning\n",
    "    - a set of tools for making inferences/causes/patterns and predictions/outcomes from data using statistics and computer science.\n",
    "    - ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "- Data Science\n",
    "    - discovering and communicating insights from data / overlaps with machine learning via machine learning models.\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning\n",
    "    - used for deciding sequential actions\n",
    "- Supervised learning\n",
    "    - observations of features and relationships between features train a model to predict a target variable. Values of observations are labelled and known.\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning\n",
    "    - training data is not labeled and only has features with no target. Is used to detect anomalies or cluster data into groups (e.g. self-driving)\n",
    "- Workflow\n",
    "    - 1. extract features\n",
    "    - 2. split dataset - train & test\n",
    "    - 3. train model\n",
    "    - 4. Evaluate model - test dataset (if percentage of accuracy is below threshold, tune and retrain model)\n",

    "     - hyperparameter tuning    -> e.g. Support Vector Machine (SVM) - change kernel from linear to poly\n",
    "     - ensemble methods         -> multiple models are used (e.g., averages for continuous variables, best 2 out of 3 for classification)\n",
